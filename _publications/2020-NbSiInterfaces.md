excerpt: 'The concentration of electrically active defects at Nb-Si interfaces can be minimized by optimizing the Si surface preperation, using an HF etch and an Ar ion mill. The dominant electrically-active defect is a Nb atom on a Si site.'

This manuscript investigates the defects at niobium-silicon interfaces to try to understand physical sources of microwave loss, then optimizes surface trreatments to minimize defect concentrations. 
The manuscript is complete, but awaiting submission for peer review.
