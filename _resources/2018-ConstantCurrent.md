This is a LabView program for measuring the temperature-dependent resistivity of a specimen with a four-point probe. The program was originally written by Lei Yu, and modified by many other students over the years including Alex Davenport, and me. It may include some modules provided by equipment vendors; those parts retain their original copyright.
