This is a LabView (2014) program for measuring Hall and Van der Pauw resistivity of a specimen. The program was originally written by Lei Yu, and modified by many other students over the years including Alex Davenport, Alex Wertheim, Aditya Ravi, and me. It includes some modules provided by equipment vendors; those parts retain their original copyright.
